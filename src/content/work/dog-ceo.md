This application has the simple mission of presenting images of various dog breeds. The user can also favorite the breeds they like the most to see more photos. However, with this project, I was able to put several knowledge into practice.

I used the Expo Managed Workflow in this project because it didn't require manipulating native code. In addition to Expo, I also utilized technologies such as React Query, Tailwind, AsyncStorage, Axios, and React Native SVG for icon manipulation.
