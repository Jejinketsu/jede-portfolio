## What is Salvus HAI

> Plan and monitor home care visits, prescriptions, and care plans in real-time.

The Salvus HAI (Healthcare Assistive Intelligence) app focuses on assisting Homecare centers in managing their healthcare professionals and medical visits to patients. With the aim of enhancing the experience of this audience, I worked on features such as medication prescription and administration, diagnosis, patient clinical progress tracking, medical assessment, and many others, catering to over 30 thousand healthcare professionals.

In this project, I put my React Native knowledge into practice, using technologies such as Expo Bare Workflow and Expo Modules, Styled-Components, Redux, SQLite, TypeORM, Yup, Unform, React Hook Forms, Atomic Design, and Clean Architecture. Additionally, I also worked on the backend using Node, MySQL, and Docker.
