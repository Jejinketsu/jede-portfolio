This project is currently in development, and I cannot provide many details yet. All I can say is that the main mission of the application is to facilitate contact between people who want to sell their cars and potential buyers.

The project is a monorepo that uses the <a href="https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create-t3-turbo</a> template, ensuring the entire application is TypeSafe. We utilize Next.js on both the front-end and back-end, while the app uses React Native. Additionally, we employ technologies such as React Query, tRPC, Tailwind, Prisma, Clerk, and PlanetScale.
